# CWDebug - Simple assembly-level debugger for AmigaOS

Copyright (c) 2018, 2019, Constantin Wiemer

CWDebug is a simple assembly-level debugger for AmigaOS. It has a simple CLI (similiar to the one provided by GDB) and allows single-stepping through the code, setting breakpoints and inspecting registers, memory and the stack. I wrote it just for educational purposes and fun, so it has only basic functionality and will for sure contain bugs. Originally, I had planned to add source-level debugging capabilities and remote debugging via a serial link. Maybe I will do this at a later time.
